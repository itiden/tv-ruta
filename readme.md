# TV-ruta

## Getting started
1. Install `yarn`
1. Start the server `yarn workspace server start`
1. Build with `yarn dev`
1. Visit `localhost:6001`

## How to create a new ruta
Simply run `yarn make:ruta --name awesome-ruta-name` and you will have a brand new folder called `awesome-ruta-name` inside the `packages` folder :)

If you want a bigger ruta, open `index.tsx` and update the grid options.

Now rerun the build script (`yarn dev`), and it will show up.
